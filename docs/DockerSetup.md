As an alternative to a Virtual Machine, you can setup a docker container.

Steps to run a tensorflow container are documented [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker) as follows...

[Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

You can download the docker container from [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tensorflow/tensorflow/tags/), using the following command

    docker pull tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.1-py3-jupyter 

To start Jupyter notebook

    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.1-py3-jupyter
    
The terminal should give you a URL to browse to where Jupyter notebook will be running.

Verify the Jupyter notebook works by entering the following in a new notebook...

    import tensorflow as tf
    with tf.compat.v1.Session() as sess:
        hello = tf.constant('Hello tensorflow')
        print(sess.run(hello))
        sess.close()

Note the data isn't necessarily saved to disk, to save data to disk you'll want to do something like this...

    docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -e JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes -v /Users/{username}/src/docker/jupyter:/tf/home/notebooks tensorflow/tensorflow:2.0.1-py3-jupyter

Now in a jupyter notebook save a file to /home/notebooks/test ( it should be available at /Users/{username}/src/docker/jupyter/test.ipynb )

You can connect pyCharm to a container running tensorflow using the steps documented [here](https://timodenk.com/blog/connecting-pycharm-to-a-tensorflow-docker-container/)
