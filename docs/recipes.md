## [Dedicated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)

You may have an old laptop or desktop with an outdated OS and you would like to re-purpose it.

## [Dual or multiple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-booting)

Dual boot; two or more operating systems on a personal computer. You may prefer to keep existing installation *as-is* and 
add another operating system directly on the computer without affecting current set-up.  When you boot you computer the BIOS will present multiple choices of OS to boot the device

## [Virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization)

Keep current set-up as is and install an operating system within a virtual machine software such as [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/). When you boot you PC you will then need to start-up the VM software.

## [Container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization)
Keep current set-up as is and install an operating system within a container engine software such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). When you boot you PC you will then need to start-up the container instance(s).
